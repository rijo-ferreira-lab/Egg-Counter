# Egg-Counter
Code for processing egg tray images and counting eggs.

There are two methods provided in the `preprocessing.ipynb`:
1. Suitable for low-contrast, low-resolution images.
2. More precise for high-contrast images.

Note: Pleas upload images without borders, capturing only the white tray part (if not done so, the edge detector goes off).
